    <h1>Houston</h1>
    <div class="about">
        <p>
            <b>Houston</b> is the most populous city in Texas and in the Southern United States.
            It is the fourth most populous city in the United States after New York City, Los Angeles
            and Chicago, and the sixth most populous city in North America. With a population of 2,304,580
            in 2020, Houston is located in Southeast Texas near Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, it
            is the seat and largest city of Harris County and the principal city of the Greater Houston
            metropolitan area, which is the fifth-most populous metropolitan statistical area in the
            United States and the second-most populous in Texas after Dallas–Fort Worth. Houston is
            the southeast anchor of the greater megaregion known as the Texas Triangle.

            The city of Houston was founded by land investors on August 30, 1836, at the confluence of
            Buffalo Bayou and White Oak Bayou (a point now known as Allen's Landing) and incorporated as
            a city on June 5, 1837. The city is named after former General Sam Houston, who was
            president of the Republic of Texas and had won Texas's independence from Mexico at the Battle
            of San Jacinto 25 miles (40 km) east of Allen's Landing. After briefly serving as the capital
            of the Texas Republic in the late 1830s, Houston grew steadily into a regional trading center for
            the remainder of the 19th century.

            Nicknamed the "Bayou City", "Space City", "H-Town", and "the 713", Houston has become a global city,
            with strengths in culture, medicine, and research. The city has a population from various ethnic and
            religious backgrounds and a large and growing international community. Houston is the most diverse
            metropolitan area in Texas and has been described as the most racially and ethnically diverse major
            city in the U.S. It is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, which attract more than
            seven million visitors a year to the Museum District. The Museum District is home to nineteen museums,
            galleries, and community spaces. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene in the Theater
            District, and offers year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.

            The Houston area occupying land that was home of the Karankawa and the Atakapa indigenous
            peoples for at least 2,000 years before the first known settlers arrived.
            These tribes are almost nonexistent today; this was most likely caused by foreign disease,
            and competition with various settler groups in the 18th and 19th centuries.
            However, the land then remained largely uninhabited from the late 1700s until settlement in the 1830s.

            The Allen brothers—Augustus Chapman and John Kirby—explored town sites on Buffalo Bayou and Galveston Bay.
            According to historian David McComb, "[T]he brothers, on August 26, 1836, bought from Elizabeth E. Parrott,
            wife of T.F.L. Parrott and widow of John Austin, the south half of the lower league [2,214-acre (896 ha)
            tract] granted to her by her late husband. They paid $5,000 total, but only $1,000 of this in cash;
            notes made up the remainder."

            The Allen brothers ran their first advertisement for Houston just four days later in the Telegraph and Texas
            Register, naming the notional town in honor of President Sam Houston.They successfully lobbied the
            Republic of Texas Congress to designate Houston as the temporary capital, agreeing to provide the new
            government with a state capitol building. About a dozen persons resided in the town at the beginning
            of 1837, but that number Republic of Texas granted Houston incorporation on June 5, 1837, as James S.
            Holman became its first mayor. In the same year, Houston became the county seat of Harrisburg County
            (now Harris County).

            When World War II started, tonnage levels at the port decreased and shipping activities were suspended;
            however, the war did provide economic benefits for the city. Petrochemical refineries and manufacturing
            plants were constructed along the ship channel because of the demand for petroleum and synthetic rubber
            products by the defense industry during the war. Ellington Field, initially built during World War I,
            was revitalized as an advanced training center for bombardiers and navigators.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the late 1970s, Houston had a population boom as people from the Rust Belt states moved to Texas in
            large numbers. The new residents came for numerous employment opportunities in the petroleum industry,
            created as a result of the Arab oil embargo. With the increase in professional jobs, Houston has become a
            destination for many college-educated persons, most recently including African Americans in a reverse Great
            Migration from northern areas.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1997, Houstonians elected Lee P. Brown as the city's first African American mayor.

        <h3 id="21age">Early 21st century</h3>
        <p>
            Houston has continued to grow into the 21st century, with the population increasing 17% from 2000 to
            2019.
        </p>
        <p>
            Oil & gas have continued to fuel Houston's economic growth, with major oil companies including Phillips 66,
            ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum, Halliburton, and ExxonMobil having their headquarters in the Houston
            area. In 2001, Enron Corporation, a Houston company with $100 billion in revenue, became engulfed in an
            accounting scandal which bankrupted the company in 2001. Health care has emerged as a major industry in
            Houston. The Texas Medical Center is now the largest medical complex in the world and employs 106,000
            people.
        </p>
        <p>
            Three new sports stadiums opened downtown in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2000, the Houston
            Astros opened their new baseball stadium, Minute Maid Park, in downtown adjacent to the old Union Station.
            The Houston Texans were formed in 2002 as an NFL expansion team, replacing the Houston Oilers, which had
            left the city in 1996. NRG Stadium opened the same year. In 2003, the Toyota Center opened as the home for
            the Houston Rockets. In 2005, the Houston Dynamo soccer team was formed. In 2017, the Houston Astros won
            their first World Series.

            Flooding has been a recurring problem in the Houston area, exacerbated by a lack of zoning laws, which
            allowed unregulated building of residential homes and other structures in flood-prone areas. In June
            2001, Tropical Storm Allison dumped up to 40 inches (1,000 mm) of rain on parts of Houston, causing what was
            then the worst flooding in the city's history and billions of dollars in damage, and killed 20 people in
            Texas. In August 2005, Houston became a shelter to more than 150,000 people from New Orleans, who
            evacuated from Hurricane Katrina. One month later, about 2.5 million Houston-area residents evacuated
            when Hurricane Rita approached the Gulf Coast, leaving little damage to the Houston area. This was the
            largest urban evacuation in the history of the United States. In May 2015, seven people died after
            12 inches of rain fell in 10 hours during what is known as the Memorial Day Flood. Eight people died in
            April 2016 during a storm that dropped 17 inches of rain. The worst came in late August 2017, when
            Hurricane Harvey stalled over southeastern Texas, much like Tropical Storm Allison did sixteen years
            earlier, causing severe flooding in the Houston area, with some areas receiving over 50 inches (1,300 mm) of
            rain.The rainfall exceeded 50 inches in several areas locally, breaking the national record for
            rainfall. The damage for the Houston area was estimated at up to $125 billion U.S. dollars, and was
            considered to be one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States, with the death
            toll exceeding 70 people.

            Houston is 165 miles (266 km) east of Austin, 88 miles (142 km) west of the Louisiana border, and
            250 miles (400 km) south of Dallas. The city has a total area of 637.4 square miles (1,651 km2); this
            comprises over 599.59 square miles (1,552.9 km2) of land and 22.3 square miles (58 km2) covered by
            water. Most of Houston is on the gulf coastal plain, and its vegetation is classified as Western Gulf
            coastal grasslands while further north, it transitions into a subtropical jungle, the Big Thicket.

            Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, or swamps, and all are still visible in
            surrounding
            areas. Flat terrain and extensive greenfield development have combined to worsen flooding. Downtown
            stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 150
            feet (46 m) in elevation. The city once relied on groundwater for its needs, but land subsidence forced
            the city to turn to ground-level water sources such as Lake Houston, Lake Conroe, and Lake
            Livingston. The city owns surface water rights for 1.20 billion US gallons (4.5 Gl) of water a day
            in addition to 150 million US gallons (570 Ml) a day of groundwater.
        </p>
        <p>
            Houston has four major bayous passing through the city that accept water from the extensive drainage
            system.
            Buffalo Bayou runs through Downtown and the Houston Ship Channel, and has three tributaries: White Oak
            Bayou, which runs through the Houston Heights community northwest of Downtown and then towards Downtown;
            Brays Bayou, which runs along the Texas Medical Center; and Sims Bayou, which runs through the south of
            Houston and Downtown Houston. The ship channel continues past Galveston and then into the Gulf of
            Mexico.

        <h3 id="climate">Climate</h3>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Houston's climate is classified as humid subtropical (Cfa in the Köppen climate classification system),
            typical of the Southern United States. While not in Tornado Alley, like much of Northern Texas, spring
            supercell thunderstorms sometimes bring tornadoes to the area. Prevailing winds are from the south and
            southeast during most of the year, which bring heat and moisture from the nearby Gulf of Mexico and
            Galveston Bay.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the summer, temperatures reach or exceed 90 °F (32 °C) an average of 106.5 days per year,
            including a
            majority of days from June to September. Additionally, an average of 4.6 days per year reach or exceed
            100
            °F (37.8 °C). Houston's characteristic subtropical humidity often results in a higher apparent
            temperature, and summer mornings average over 90% relative humidity. Air conditioning is ubiquitous in
            Houston; in 1981, annual spending on electricity for interior cooling exceeded $600 million (equivalent
            to
            $1.79 billion in 2021), and by the late 1990s, approximately 90% of Houston homes featured air
            conditioning
            systems. The record highest temperature recorded in Houston is 109 °F (43 °C) at Bush
            Intercontinental Airport, during September 4, 2000, and again on August 27, 2011.

            Houston has mild winters, with occasional cold spells. In January, the normal mean temperature at George
            Bush Intercontinental Airport is 53 °F (12 °C), with an average of 13 days per year with a low at or
            below
            32 °F (0 °C), occurring on average between December 3 and February 20, allowing for a growing season of
            286
            days. Twenty-first century snow events in Houston include a storm on December 24, 2004, which saw 1 inch
            (3 cm) of snow accumulate in parts of the metro area, and an event on December 7, 2017, which
            precipitated 0.7 inches (2 cm) of snowfall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Houston generally receives ample rainfall, averaging about 49.8 in (1,260 mm) annually based on records
            between 1981 and 2010. Many parts of the city have a high risk of localized flooding due to flat
            topography, ubiquitous low-permeability clay-silt prairie soils, and inadequate
            infrastructure. During the mid-2010s, Greater Houston experienced consecutive major flood events in
            2015 ("Memorial Day"), 2016 ("Tax Day"), and 2017 (Hurricane Harvey). Overall, there have
            been more casualties and property loss from floods in Houston than in any other locality in the United
            States. The majority of rainfall occurs between April and October (the wet season of Southeast Texas),
            when the moisture from the Gulf of Mexico evaporates extensively over the city.

            Houston had the fifth-tallest skyline in North America (after New York City, Chicago, Toronto and Miami)
            and
            36th-tallest in the world in 2015. A seven-mile (11 km) system of tunnels and skywalks links Downtown
            buildings containing shops and restaurants, enabling pedestrians to avoid summer heat and rain while
            walking
            between buildings. In the 1960s, Downtown Houston consisted of a collection of mid-rise office
            structures.
            Downtown was on the threshold of an energy industry–led boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was
            built
            throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines—culminating with Houston's tallest
            skyscraper, the 75-floor, 1,002-foot (305 m)-tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce
            Tower),
            completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 19th tallest building in the United States, and
            was
            previously 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the
            71-floor, 992-foot (302 m)-tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming
            the
            second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the
            21st-tallest
            in the United States. In 2007, Downtown had over 43 million square feet (4,000,000 m2) of office space.

            Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and
            early
            1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along
            Interstate 610 West. Uptown became one of the most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest
            building
            in Uptown is the 64-floor, 901-foot (275 m)-tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark
            Williams
            Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the
            world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and
            BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30 years. The Uptown District
            is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In
            the
            late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred,
            with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 over 30 skyscrapers have been developed in
            Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002,
            Uptown had more than 23 million square feet (2,100,000 m2) of office space with 16 million square feet
            (1,500,000 m2) of class A office space.

        Houston is recognized worldwide for its energy industry—particularly for oil and natural gas—as well as for
        biomedical research and aeronautics. Renewable energy sources—wind and solar—are also growing economic bases
        in the city, and the City Government purchases 90% of its annual 1 TWh power mostly from wind, and
        some from solar. The city has also been a growing hub for technology startup firms. Major
        technology and software companies within Greater Houston include Crown Castle, KBR, Cybersoft, Houston Wire
        & Cable, and HostGator. On April 4, 2022, Hewlett Packard Enterprise relocated its global headquarters from
        California to the Greater Houston area. The Houston Ship Channel is also a large part of Houston's
        economic base.

        Because of these strengths, Houston is designated as a global city by the Globalization and World Cities
        Study Group and Network and global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney. The Houston area is the top
        U.S. market for exports, surpassing New York City in 2013, according to data released by the U.S. Department
        of Commerce's International Trade Administration. In 2012, the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land area
        recorded $110.3 billion in merchandise exports. Petroleum products, chemicals, and oil and gas
        extraction equipment accounted for roughly two-thirds of the metropolitan area's exports last year. The top
        three destinations for exports were Mexico, Canada, and Brazil.
